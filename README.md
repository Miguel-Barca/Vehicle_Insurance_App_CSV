ðŸ“š Vehicle Insurance App:
===============


Robot Framework project for Webapp.

This repository contains test cases designed with Robot Framework to assess the functionality of a web application hosted at http://sampleapp.tricentis.com/. 

The test suite includes a variety of scenarios, such as reading data from a CSV file containing car information, efficiently testing multiple data points within a single test case, and completing web forms. 

To enhance test data management, a custom data manager class has been implemented. Also made use of dictionaries, lists, and 'for in range' loops. 

These test cases serve as a comprehensive demonstration of automated web testing using Robot Framework.
